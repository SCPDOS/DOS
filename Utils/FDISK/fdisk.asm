;FDISK utility for SCP/DOS 1.0
;Bypases filesystem to "low-level format" the target fixed disk.
;Restarts the machine upon completion by triple faulting.

;Steps taken:
;0) Call Int 4Ah/EAX=0h. If it returns ah <> 0, then tell the user to
;    stop any other tasks and networking software before continuing.
;    Give them a "Press Enter to continue or ESC to return to DOS" prompt.
;1) Queries the BIOS implementation (in this case SCP/BIOS) for the number
;    of fixed disks.
; Enter the Menu.
;Main menu will have 4 main options and 1 optional option
;   1) Create 

;If the user wants to create a new partition, we ask them how much of the 
; disk they want their partioned to take up as a percentage from 1%-99%
;We then round to the nearest cylinder (multiple of 64 sectors), 
; rounding up (if 0) or down (if past max sector).
